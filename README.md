# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In addition to the date, add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Backgorund
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
1. With no filter, the page will show all the table information.

2. In the Filter Search bos, input desired information.

3. Clear the filter to show all the table information again. 

## Summary
The page would be more interesting if in the UFO sightings we can have a link to the picture or video of the sighting. 
Additionaly, instead of having a textbox, change to a dropbox so the user can know what information is available and filters with no information can't be displayed.
